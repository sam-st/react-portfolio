        Hi! My name is Sam and I am a student of the PennLPS Web Development Boot Camp. Other than this course I studied programming in college, and before college I have some experience as well, totalling just over 10 years of programming at an intermediate level. I took this course to get myself to the next level of programming and become a professional Web Developer.
